      <h2>Hobbies</h2>
      <p>Resourcing to <i>Wikipedia</i> I got that:</p>
      <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_hobbies">
        "A hobby is an activity, interest, enthusiasm, or pastime that is
        undertaken for pleasure or relaxation, done during one's own time".
      </blockquote>
      <p>As I said before, I'm always looking for things to do and learn. So
        through my life I passed through many and many hobbies, some that lasted
        less than a week. So, obviously, I'll talk just about the ones more
        important to me starting for those that I'm doing for a longer time.</p>

      <h3>Videogames</h3>

         <p>I started playing videogames since I was a kid in a
           <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sega_Genesis">
           Mega Drive(aka Sega Genesis)</a>.
           And since then the feeling of challenging yourself, knowing a new world
           and seeing a beautiful story never changed. Through videogames I
           learned <i>English</i>, I sharpen my logic, improved my reflexes, they
           made me a better person. And I know they will continue to do.</p>

      <h3>Volleyball</h3>

      <p>Volleyball is the sport that I most love. You have your space to do your
        best, but you can only touch the ball once. At the same time that it calls
        for individual performance, it isn't playable without teamwork. I played
        since 2012, but this year I stopped because of my academic schedule, but
        I'll soon start to play again.</p>

      <h3>Digital Arts</h3>
      <p><a target="_blank" href="https://inkscape.org/"><img class="right" alt="Inkscape"

        width="100px" height="100px"/></a></p>
      <p>I developed this interest after entering the university. We were in need
        for artistis in the Academic Center so here I go looking for tutorials on the internet.</p>
      <p>It is one of my favorite hobbies, but it is surely the hardest one! I'm not
        very good with spatial memory and not very coordinated too, but I looking
        forward to day the day I'll be!</p>
      <p>In the <a class="link" href="art.html">My Arts</a> page there are some
        arts that I've done if you're curious to see.</p>

      <h2>Linux</h2>

        width="100px" height="100px"/></a></p>
      <p>The Linux operational system is a major tool in the computing area, but
        I also consider it a hobby of mine.</p>
      <p>I'm currently using the Manjaro OS and I love spending hours and hours
        customizing it and making it beautiful to me. Of course many of these hours
        it's also for fixing problems that linux always have, but I wouldn't change
        for any other system. For me freedom comes before stability!</p>

      <h3>Musical Instruments</h3>

      <p>Playing instruments is definitively the hobby that I'm worst at. I started
        playing Acoustic Guitar when I was around 12 years old, but I did just one
        year of classes. Then, three years later I started learning again through
        the internet and that's what I do till this day.</p>
      <p>But Acoustic Guitar isn't the only one I tried to learn, I tried Piano,
        Flute (they teach us in school), Ukulele and Scale (all of this I borrowed
        from friends or my girlfriend). And my latest purchase that I'm really loving
        it is my Otamotone (the one from the picture)!</p>
