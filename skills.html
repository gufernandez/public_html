      <h2>Skills</h2>
      <p>Skill is a term that can include many knowledges of life. I'll be
        considering those who appears to be most useful in a professional manner.
        I don't consider myself expert at none of them, but there are some that
        I am more familar than others. Here I'll treat them all equally, because
        it's a very dynamic relationship: one semester I know more about one and
        in the next I forget a little about it. But I'm always seeking the best
        for my needs! </p>

      <h3>Languages</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Portuguese (Brazilian): Native.</li>
        <li>English: Advanced.</li>
        <p>I studied English since I was 5 years old in my school. There they teach
          us the basic, but is very helpful. When I was around 10 I started a
          language school that brought my English to the level it is today. I consume
          English content daily through news, media and computing material, so my listening
          and reading level is great. But I have lot of work to apply on my speaking.</p>
        <li>Spanish: Intermediate.</li>
        <p>I also studied Spanish since I was 5 in my school, but I never did a language
          school for it. There are a lot of similarity with portuguese and I have more
          contact with it through my grandparents, who are born in Spain (I have Spanish
          nationality), but I'm still expanding my vocabulary.</p>
        <li>Japanese: Beginner</li>
        <p>I started studying Japanese on August of this year (2018). My city have a
        large Japanese community, most of my school friends are descendants of
        Japaneses (my girlfriend was born in Japan!). So I always had this contact
        with Japan culture, it was time to start learning the language! I still
        a large path to travel, but I'm confident I will!</p>
