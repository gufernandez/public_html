      <h2>Arts</h2>
      <p>My history with arts started first with videos. In the college me and
        my friends always wanted to make videos for any kind of assignments, and
        we did! Unfortunately, most of these videos were lost through time. </p>
      <p>Then I've entered the universisty and joined the Academic Center of
        Computing. There we did events to the students of our course and we needed
        divulgation material to get their attention. So I started to learn and try
        more about programs of digital drawing. I learned about Photoshop and Gimp,
        but I realized I was more fond of Vector drawing, so I learned Illustrator
        and Inkscape! Below are some of my <del>terrible</del> works.</p>

      <h3 style="text-align: center;">The First</h3>
      <a target="_blank" href="./images/arts/CACo Games.png"><img class="art"
        alt="CACo Games Art" src="./images/arts/CACo Games.png" width="670px"
        height="378px"/></a>
      <p class="sub">This is the first art I made. Created for a Gaming Tournament for the
        students of Computing. It's basically a cut and copy from various arts I found
        on the internet.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="imgcard right">
      <h3 style="text-align: center;">Minimalism</h3>
      <a target="_blank" href="./images/arts/Totoro.jpg"><img class="art"
        alt="Wallpaper" src="./images/arts/Totoro.jpg" width="346px"
        height="595px"/></a>
      <p class="sub">Then I started to try to create more by myself. I really
        enjoy minimalist arts, so I tried to give it a shot.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="imgcard left">
      <h3 style="text-align: center;">Best Feedback</h3>
      <a target="_blank" href="./images/arts/CACo Games VII.jpg"><img class="art"
        alt="CACo Games VII" src="./images/arts/CACo Games VII.jpg" width="670px"
        height="378px"/></a>
      <p class="sub">This is the art that I received more compliments about. It
        was for a CACo Games too (the tournament I mentioned above) and hearing the
        people talking about it and saying nice thing were heartwarming!</p>
      <p class="sub">For those who don't recognize it, it is inspired on the art
        of <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/it/a/af/Final_Fantasy_VII_Logo.png">
        Final Fantasy VII</a>..</p>
    </div>

    <div class="imgcard right">
      <h3 style="text-align: center;">More from CACo</h3>
      <a target="_blank" href="./images/arts/cacoruby1.png"><img class="art"
        alt="Ruby Marketing" src="./images/arts/cacoruby1.png" width="346px"
        height="350px"/></a>
      <p class="sub">This is one of the arts I made for a Workshop of Ruby on the
        Academic Center. The background I got online, but the rest it's mine.
        I really enjoyed my Kermit!</p>
      <p class="sub">*In Brazil Kermit is called Caco! That's why he's the mascot of our Academic Center (CACo).</p>

    <div class="imgcard left">
      <h3 style="text-align: center;">Lollibeach</h3>
      <a target="_blank" href="./images/arts/lollibeach2.png"><img class="art"
        alt="Lollibeach" src="./images/arts/lollibeach2.png" width="670px"
        height="378px"/></a>
      <p class="sub">This is my last art, I call it "Lollibeach". It's a little
        abstract, a little minimalist and maybe a little weird. All of it was done
        by myself in Inkscape and maybe I'm being a delusional artist here, but I
        really like it!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="imgcard right" style="width: 358px">
      <h3 style="text-align: center;">More?</h3>
      <p class="sub">This is just a summary of this hobby of mine. I have other
        arts saved, but I don't want to polute anymore here.</p>
      <p class="sub">It's being a while since my last one, but I hope I have some
        time for more in the future.</p>
