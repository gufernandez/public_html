      <h2>My Life</h2>
      <p> My name is <b>Gustavo Fernandez da Costa</b>. I was born in
      <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://goo.gl/maps/5dhNagv9Ajk">
        Guarulhos,SP - Brazil</a>
        at 21h06 in August 8th, 1996. And for the next 18 years I lived in this
        city.</p>
      <p>Guarulhos is one of the biggest munipals in Brazil, it's right next to
        SÃ£o Paulo, one of the most populated cities on the planet. All this
        scenario shaped me a lot. I just love living in the urban area and I
        believe I always will.</p>
      <p>My childhood consisted on playing videogames with my older brother and
        travelling through the country, my parents loved it. When I grew older I
        started staying more afternoons in my college <i>Mater Amabilis</i> to
        study and stay with friends.</p>
      <p>I always loved to learn new things (besides the school subjects). I was
        constantly learning new musical instruments, how to draw, dances, sports,
        scultures... but I never really specialized in anything too. For that,
        it was very difficult to choose a Graduation course to follow, I thought
        on many options and then chose Computing Engineering. I confess this was
        more of a bet at the time, I wasn't very at the time, but now in the
        Fourth year of the university I really think it was worth it.</p>

        <h2>Nowadays</h2>
        <p>I'm now on my Fourth year in Computer Engineering at the State
          University of Campinas (UNICAMP), next year will be my last. So I'm
          starting to look for job opportunities, but with very caution. I want
          to work in a job that I really believe and I'm passionate about. My
          first desire would be an internship in another country (I'm mostly
          interested in Japan), but if that isn't possible there are many great
          companies in Brazil that I'd like too.</p>
        <p>As side projects on this quest I'm also learning <i>Japanese</i>,
          planning to learn soon <i>German</i> too; I'm in a project with two
          friend about an application; and always learning new things everyday
          through books, podcasts or any other media, something that I hope to
          do forever</p>
